**Agora** is an open-source, experimental coordination engine designed to help humans organize collective action transparently, efficiently, and across borders.

It explores whether **reputation-based governance**, **verifiable execution**, and **open participation** can outperform traditional hierarchical institutions for certain classes of problems.

---

## The Problem

Humanity faces problems that require large-scale cooperation:

* Infrastructure and public goods
* Environmental restoration
* Security and disaster response
* Open knowledge and software

Yet coordination is mostly limited by:

* Territorial governance
* Centralized trust
* Opaque execution
* Weak accountability

In many regions, corruption and inefficiency make cooperation irrational.

---

## The Hypothesis

If:

* Contributions are visible
* Execution is measurable
* Reputation is earned and lost
* Funds are released conditionally

Then cooperation becomes **the rational strategy**.

Agora exists to test this hypothesis.

---

## Core Principles

* **Reputation > Authority**
* **Execution > Promises**
* **Transparency > Trust**
* **Open Participation**
* **Global by Default**

---

## What Agora Is Not

* Not a cryptocurrency product
* Not a DAO hype project
* Not a replacement for all governments
* Not a finished system

---

## Architecture Overview

Agora is built as a modular system:

* **Node** – P2P networking and event propagation
* **Identity** – Human and agent identities with reputation
* **Ledger** – Immutable history of actions and outcomes
* **Governance** – Proposals, voting, and execution triggers
* **Economy** – Treasury, milestones, rewards, slashing
* **API** – Interfaces for web, mobile, and CLI clients

Each component can evolve independently.

---

## What You Can Do With Agora

* Propose and fund real-world projects
* Coordinate volunteer or paid execution
* Audit projects and earn reputation
* Participate locally or globally

Projects can be:

* Physical or digital
* Local or global
* Paid or volunteer-based

---

## Status

Agora is **early-stage and experimental**.

Expect:

* Rapid changes
* Incomplete features
* Ongoing design discussions

This is a research-driven effort.

---

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — especially:

* Critical feedback
* Alternative designs
* Small, focused improvements

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

## License

Core system: **AGPLv3**
Clients and SDKs: **MIT / Apache 2.0**

The goal is freedom, auditability, and global reproducibility.

---

## Final Thought

Agora may fail.

But attempting new coordination models is less dangerous than endlessly repeating broken ones.
