# Minimal Use Case (MUC)

## Purpose

This document defines the **Minimal Use Case (MUC)** for Agora.

The goal of this MUC is **not** to prove that Agora can replace governments or solve all coordination problems**, but to test a single, falsifiable hypothesis:

> *Can a reputation-based, transparent coordination system execute a real community project more efficiently and transparently than informal or opaque methods?*

This MUC acts as a **design constraint** for the MVP and as the **specification for the first real-world pilot**.

---

## Context

A small rural community in Colombia decides to experiment with a new way of coordinating a **single community project**.

* Participation is voluntary
* No legal or political confrontation is involved
* The experiment runs in parallel to existing institutions

The community has limited resources and prior experience with informal coordination methods that lack transparency and accountability.

---

## Participants

* **25 participants** total
* All participants create an Agora identity
* All participants start with the same immutable base reputation

Roles (non-exclusive):

* **Proposers** – submit project proposals
* **Executors** – carry out approved project tasks
* **Auditors** – verify progress, expenses, and outcomes

Any participant may take multiple roles, subject to reputation rules.

---

## Project Scope

Only **one project** is executed in this MUC.

Example project types (choose one):

* Repair of a short community road segment
* Installation of a shared water tank
* Community-owned power generator setup

Constraints:

* Fixed and capped budget
* Clearly defined deliverables
* Duration limited to **4–6 weeks**

---

## Governance Flow

1. A project proposal is submitted via Agora
2. Proposal includes:

   * Objective
   * Budget breakdown
   * Timeline
   * Required roles
3. Community votes using simple majority
4. If approved, the project enters execution

Voting power is initially equal for all participants.

---

## Execution Model

* Executors opt-in to available tasks
* Final task assignment is determined via **algorithmic selection** among eligible participants
* Funds are released in **milestones**, not upfront

Execution data recorded:

* Task completion
* Expenses
* Proof of work (photos, receipts, logs)

---

## Audit Model

* Any participant may act as an auditor
* Auditors review:

  * Milestone completion
  * Expense validity
  * Deliverable quality

Audit actions:

* Approve
* Request clarification
* Flag inconsistency

Audits are publicly visible.

---

## Reputation Rules

Reputation changes are limited and conservative in this MUC.

Reputation increases for:

* Successful proposal approval
* Verified task completion
* Accurate audits

Reputation decreases for:

* Failed execution
* Proven misuse of funds
* False or negligent audits

Reputation directly affects eligibility for execution and auditing roles, but not voting power in this MUC.

---

## Ledger Requirements

The ledger must record:

* Proposal creation
* Votes
* Milestone releases
* Expenses
* Audit results
* Reputation changes

The ledger serves as an immutable historical record for post-experiment evaluation.

---

## Success Criteria

The MUC is considered **successful** if:

* The project is completed within scope and budget
* All expenses are auditable and verifiable
* Participants can clearly track progress and decisions
* Reputation changes reflect perceived performance

---

## Failure Criteria

The MUC is considered **failed** if:

* The project cannot be completed
* Funds cannot be accounted for
* Coordination breaks down due to lack of clarity
* Reputation signals do not correlate with behavior

Failure is an acceptable and valuable outcome.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

This MUC does **not** attempt to test:

* Replacement of government institutions
* Legal resistance or political pressure
* Cryptocurrency adoption
* Long-term cultural change
* Large-scale infrastructure

These are intentionally excluded.

---

## Outcome

Upon completion, the experiment will produce:

* A complete execution history
* Reputation distribution data
* Identified coordination strengths and failures

These results will inform the next iteration of Agora.
