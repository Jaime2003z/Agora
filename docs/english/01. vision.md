## Purpose
AGORA is an open, decentralized protocol for **verifiable human coordination and execution**. Its goal is to enable communities anywhere to identify real needs, decide collectively, fund actions transparently, and verify outcomes—without requiring permission from states, corporations, or centralized platforms.

## Principles
- **Human-first identity**: one human, one voice—resistant to Sybil attacks.
- **Verifiability over trust**: decisions, funds, and outcomes are auditable.
- **Execution, not promises**: approved proposals trigger measurable action.
- **Open by default**: core logic remains free and forkable (AGPLv3).
- **Local autonomy, global interoperability**: communities act locally using shared protocols.

## Non-Goals
- Replacing states by force or coercion.
- Enforcing ideology or politics.
- Providing custody of user funds.
