## Purpose
AGORA is an open, decentralized protocol for **verifiable human coordination and execution**. Its goal is to enable communities anywhere to identify real needs, decide collectively, fund actions transparently, and verify outcomes—without requiring permission from states, corporations, or centralized platforms.

## Principles
- **Human-first identity**: one human, one voice—resistant to Sybil attacks.
- **Verifiability over trust**: decisions, funds, and outcomes are auditable.
- **Execution, not promises**: approved proposals trigger measurable action.
- **Open by default**: core logic remains free and forkable (AGPLv3).
- **Local autonomy, global interoperability**: communities act locally using shared protocols.

## Non-Goals
- Replacing states by force or coercion.
- Enforcing ideology or politics.
- Providing custody of user funds.

## High-Level Overview
AGORA follows a layered architecture separating **power** from **interfaces**.

```

P2P Network + Distributed Storage
```

## Components

### Core Node (Go)
- Deterministic rules engine
- P2P networking and discovery
- Ledger validation and storage
- Governance and economic execution

### Crypto Modules (Rust)
- Signatures and verification
- Advanced proofs (optional: ZK/PoP)
- Memory-safe cryptographic primitives

### Storage
- **Ledger**: append-only, verifiable (blocks + Merkle roots)
- **State DB**: local, rebuildable from ledger
- **Docs/Artifacts**: IPFS/Arweave (hashes anchored on ledger)

### Clients
- Thin clients; no authority
- Interact with local or remote nodes

## Trust Model
- No trusted third parties
- Any node can be verified independently
- Clients may distrust nodes and verify proofs
