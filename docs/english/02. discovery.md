## Purpose
Discovery defines **how projects are indexed, prioritized, and presented to humans**. It has **no authority** over decision-making or execution. Its only role is to make the system usable at human scale.

## Core Concept: Impact Scope
Every project declares an `impact_scope`, describing *where* and *how far* its effects are felt.

```
impact_scope {
  center: latitude, longitude
  radius_km: number | "global"
}
```

The protocol does not understand political borders. All territorial meaning is derived at the client layer.

## Levels (UX Abstraction)
Levels are **client-side abstractions** derived from `radius_km`.

| Level | Typical Radius | Meaning for Users |
|------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | < 1 km | Immediate vicinity (street / block) |
| 2 | < 10 km | Neighborhood / zone |
| 3 | < 100 km | City / region |
| 4 | < 1000 km | Macro-region |
| 5 | Global | Humanity-wide |

These levels:
- do NOT grant power
- do NOT affect voting weight
- ONLY affect visibility and priority

## Client Responsibilities
Clients may:
- sort by proximity
- filter by level
- trigger notifications for nearby projects
- adapt labels to local culture (city, commune, vereda, etc.)
