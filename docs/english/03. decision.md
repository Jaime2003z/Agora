## Purpose
Decision defines **how collective consent is expressed**. It is intentionally minimal.

## Voting
A vote answers one question only:

> "Do we activate this executable project with these locked resources?"

Voting:
- does not select executors
- does not manage funds
- does not modify execution logic

## Requirements
To be votable, a project MUST include:
- defined impact_scope
- locked or lockable budget
- measurable milestones
- verification method

Text-only proposals are invalid.

## Outcome
If approved:
- funds are escrowed
- execution pipeline is activated

If rejected:
- nothing happens
