## Purpose
Execution defines **how reality is checked**.

## Milestones
Projects are split into milestones:

```
Milestone {
  metric
  verification_method
  deadline
  payout
}
```

## Verification
Verification sources may include:
- human reports with stake
- sensor data
- satellite imagery
- third-party proofs

Verification is multi-source and stake-weighted.

## Funds Flow
- Funds are escrowed on approval
- Released only on verified milestones
- Failure triggers freezes or slashing

## Reputation
- Successful execution increases reputation
- Failure or fraud reduces reputation
- Reputation is non-transferable

## Permission to Propose
Higher-scope projects require higher reputation.
