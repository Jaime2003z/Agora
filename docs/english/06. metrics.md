## Metrics System Specification

Metrics are the **only source of truth** for determining project success or failure. No single metric is sufficient; validity emerges from **convergence**.

---

## 1. Metric Definition

```go
type Metric struct {
    ID          string
    Description string
    Source      MetricSource
    Weight      float64
    Threshold   float64
}
```

- `Weight ∈ (0,1]`
- Sum of all metric weights MUST equal `1.0`

---

## 2. Metric Sources

```go
type MetricSource int

const (
    Internal MetricSource = iota
    Oracle
    Audit
)
```

### Source Roles

- **Internal**: executor-provided data (low trust, required)
- **Oracle**: external data feeds, sensors, public datasets
- **Audit**: independent actors validating consistency

No project may rely on a single source type.

## 3. Convergence Model

Each metric produces a normalized score `s ∈ [0,1]`.

```text
project_score = Σ (metric_weight × metric_score)
```

### Outcome Thresholds

| Score | Result |
|------|--------|
| ≥ 0.8 | Success |
| 0.5 – 0.79 | Partial / Review |
| < 0.5 | Failure |

---

## 4. Conflict Resolution

If metrics diverge beyond tolerance:

```text
variance > allowed_threshold → audit escalation
```

Auditors risk reputation equal to the project RiskFactor.

---

## 5. Metric Immutability

- Metrics are locked at project activation
- Any modification requires project cancellation and restart

---

## 6. Guarantees

- Metrics are public
- Raw data is verifiable
- Success cannot be self-declared
