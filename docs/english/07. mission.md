## Mission Layer Specification

Missions define **purpose without restricting capability**. The execution engine remains neutral; missions guide prioritization, funding, and visibility.

---

## 1. Mission Definition

```go
type Mission struct {
    ID            string
    Description   string
    BudgetWeight  float64
    PriorityScore float64
}
```

- `BudgetWeight` determines treasury allocation
- Missions do not execute projects; they **host** them

---

## 2. Foundational Missions (Hard-Coded)

These missions form the system's non-negotiable core:

- Environmental sustainability
- Basic infrastructure (water, energy, sanitation)
- Human security
- Open knowledge and tooling

They cannot be removed, only reweighted.

---

## 3. Budget Allocation

```text
total_treasury × mission_budget_weight = mission_budget
```

Projects compete **within missions**, not globally.

---

## 4. Mission Creation

New missions may be proposed if:

- Backed by sufficient reputation
- Assigned an initial budget weight
- Approved by weighted community vote

---

## 5. Mission Decay and Removal

Missions with:

- low execution success
- low participation
- persistent inefficiency

Experience **budget decay** over time.

Dormant missions may be archived.

---

## 6. Visibility Rules

Client applications MUST prioritize:

1. Nearby mission projects
2. High-priority missions
3. Active, funded executions

---

## 7. Guarantees

- Missions guide direction without censorship
- Funding incentives shape behavior
- No mission controls execution logic
