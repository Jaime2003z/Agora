## Treasury Layer Specification

The Treasury is a **custodial and allocation system**, not a monetary authority. It does not mint value, speculate, or govern. It **executes economic intent** defined by missions and verified by execution metrics.

---

## 1. Core Principles

- No money creation (non-inflationary)
- No discretionary releases
- Funds move only via verified milestones
- Transparency by default
- Mission-scoped allocation

---

## 2. Sources of Funds

The Treasury MAY receive value from:

- Cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, stablecoins)
- Public donations
- Community contributions
- Institutional or state grants
- Project-generated returns (optional)

All inflows are publicly auditable.

---

## 3. Custody Model

Funds are held under **non-custodial, auditable control** using:

- Multisignature schemes
- Programmatic contracts (where available)
- Time-locks for large releases
- Segregation by mission

No single actor can unilaterally move funds.

---

## 4. Mission-Scoped Allocation

Each mission receives a budget according to its weight.

```text
mission_budget = total_treasury × mission_budget_weight
```

Projects compete **within their mission**, preventing dilution of core objectives.

---

## 5. Project Escrow

Upon project activation:

1. Allocated funds move from mission budget to **project escrow**
2. Escrow is locked to project metrics and milestones
3. No manual overrides are permitted

```text
treasury → mission budget → project escrow
```

---

## 6. Milestone-Based Release

Funds are released incrementally:

- Each milestone has predefined cost and metrics
- Successful verification triggers release
- Failed milestones freeze remaining funds

```text
milestone verified → partial release
milestone failed → funds frozen or returned
```

---

## 7. Infrastructure Compensation

Nodes that execute the system infrastructure MAY receive **cost-covering compensation**:

- Electricity
- Bandwidth
- Storage

Compensation is:

- Fixed-rate
- Non-speculative
- Independent of token price
- Subject to uptime and verification

This prevents centralization while ensuring sustainability.

---

## 8. Abuse Prevention

- No rewards for idle capital
- No yield farming
- No speculative incentives
- No governance capture via wealth

Value follows execution, not possession.

---

## 9. Failure Handling

If a project fails:

- Unreleased funds return to the mission budget
- Executors lose reputation
- Auditors are penalized if negligent

Funds are never lost silently.

---

## 10. Guarantees

- The Treasury cannot be captured
- Funds cannot be siphoned
- Execution dictates economic flow
- Coordination outperforms coercion

---

The Treasury enables real-world action at scale without requiring trust in institutions, states, or intermediaries.
