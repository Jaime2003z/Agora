## Ledger Specification (Append-Only Coordination Ledger)

The ledger is a **non-mining, append-only, cryptographically verifiable log**. It exists to record facts, not to create money or consensus by force.

---

## 1. Design Goals

- Append-only (no mutation, no rollback)
- Cryptographically verifiable
- Replicated via P2P
- Low resource requirements
- No proof-of-work / no proof-of-stake

---

## 2. What the Ledger Records

The ledger stores **events**, not state.

Examples:
- Project activation
- Metric submissions
- Audit results
- Milestone verification
- Fund releases
- Reputation changes

State is always **derived**, never stored.

---

## 3. Event Structure

```go
type LedgerEvent struct {
    ID        Hash
    PrevHash  Hash
    Timestamp int64
    Type      EventType
    Payload   []byte
    Signer    PublicKey
    Signature []byte
}
```

- `PrevHash` creates the chain
- Any alteration breaks verification

---

## 4. Event Validity Rules

An event is valid if:

- Signature matches signer
- Signer has sufficient reputation
- Event references valid prior events
- Event type rules are satisfied

Invalid events are ignored, not reverted.

---

## 5. Consensus Model (Soft Consensus)

There is **no global instant consensus**.

Nodes accept events when:

- They verify cryptographically
- They converge with peer majority
- Conflicts are resolved by weight (reputation + count)

Finality is **emergent**, not forced.

---

## 6. Fork Handling

Forks may occur temporarily.

Resolution strategy:

- Prefer chain with higher cumulative verified events
- Prefer chain validated by higher reputation nodes

Forks resolve naturally over time.

---

## 7. Guarantees

- No single node controls history
- No miner dominance
- No economic attacks
- History is auditable forever
