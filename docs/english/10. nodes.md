## Node Architecture Specification

Nodes execute, replicate, and verify the system. All nodes are equal at the protocol level but differ in responsibility.

---

## 1. Node Types

```go
type NodeType int

const (
    FullNode NodeType = iota
    AuditNode
    LightNode
)
```

---

## 2. Full Nodes

Responsibilities:

- Store full ledger
- Verify all events
- Participate in fork resolution
- Serve data to other nodes

Incentives:
- Infrastructure reputation
- Cost-covering compensation

---

## 3. Audit Nodes

Responsibilities:

- Verify metrics and audits
- Cross-check oracles
- Issue audit events

Incentives:
- Reputation gain
- Eligibility for high-trust projects

Audit nodes risk reputation for incorrect validation.

---

## 4. Light Nodes

Responsibilities:

- Read ledger state
- Submit signed events
- Do not store full history

Used by:
- Mobile apps
- Web clients
- Low-resource environments

---

## 5. Networking Model

- Peer-to-peer gossip
- No central servers
- Encrypted transport
- Identity = public key

---

## 6. Node Incentives Summary

| Node | Incentive |
|----|----|
| Full | Reputation + cost coverage |
| Audit | Reputation + access |
| Light | Participation only |

---

## 7. Failure Tolerance

- Nodes may go offline without impact
- No quorum requirements
- System degrades gracefully

---

## 8. Guarantees

- No privileged node classes
- No central coordination
- Running a node increases influence
