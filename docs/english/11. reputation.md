## 1. General Principle

> Reputation is a **vector by domain**, not a single global value.

Each identity has:

* Base reputation: **10 (immutable initial)**
* Domain-specific reputation:

  * software
  * environment
  * infrastructure
  * security
  * research
  * social
  * etc.

Base reputation allows:

* voting with minimum weight
* commenting
* proposing ideas

It cannot go below 10.

## 2. Gaining Reputation

### 2.1 Through verifiable actions

| Action                   | Reputation |
| ------------------------ | ---------- |
| Accepted proposal        | +          |
| Idea reused in a project | +          |
| Well-valued comment      | +          |
| Successful execution     | ++         |
| Correct audit            | ++         |
| Validated metric         | +          |

### 2.2 Comments and ideas

* Comments that improve projects or detect problems
* Ideas that are voted on or incorporated into projects

> Both actions generate reputation proportional to impact in the corresponding domain.

### 2.3 Minimum participation

* Reputation in a domain decays slowly if inactive
* Example: −1% monthly per inactive domain
* Base reputation **does not decay**
* Participation resets decay

## 3. Losing Reputation

| Reason             | Loss |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| Failed project     | −    |
| Incorrect audit    | −−   |
| False metrics      | −−   |
| Abandoning project | −    |
| Detected collusion | −−−  |

## 4. Vote Weight Formula

### 4.1 Principle

> Everyone votes, but not all votes have equal weight. Weight depends on domain, project level, and recent activity.

### 4.2 Conceptual formula

```text
vote_weight = base_factor + domain_factor + activity_factor
```

* **base_factor** = 1 (minimum democracy)
* **domain_factor** = sqrt(reputation_in_domain) (square root prevents oligarchy)
* **activity_factor** = temporary bonus for recent participation

Example:

* rep = 1 → weight +1
* rep = 100 → weight +10
* rep = 400 → weight +20

This ensures emotional votes exist but do not dominate.

---

## 5. Audit Economy (Reward / Slash)

### 5.1 Audit = risk contract

* Auditor applies to a project
* Commits to scope, metrics, deadlines
* Submits report
* Other auditors and oracles cross-check
* Result is recorded in the ledger

### 5.2 Rewards

If audit is correct:

* * reputation in domain
* * auditor reputation
* * payment from project treasury (covers time/resources, does not buy authority)

### 5.3 Slashing (penalty)

* Incorrect or negligent audit:

  * − reputation (fast and strong)
  * possible temporary audit block
  * loss of future income opportunities

### 5.4 Multiple audits

* No single auditor decides alone
* Multiple independent audits
* Consensus emerges naturally
* Collusion = severe reputational loss

---

## 6. Incentive Summary

* Comments and ideas → early participation
* Project execution → reputation and access to strategic projects
* Audits → reputation + moderate monetary reward
* Inactivity → gradual domain-specific decay

The system ensures **action, knowledge, and real participation** are always more valuable than inactivity or empty opinion.

---

## 7. Selection by Algorithm (Not Voting)

* Participants can gain money and reputation through project management
* **They are never directly elected by voting**
* Instead, an algorithm selects eligible actors:

  * Checks capabilities, domain reputation, and commitment
  * Uses algorithmic randomness to choose among qualified candidates

This prevents popularity or bias while maintaining fairness and incentivizing competence.

---

## 8. Project Execution Model (Agile + PERT/CPM)

Projects MUST follow an auditable execution framework combining **Agile practices** with **PERT/CPM planning** to ensure transparency, predictability, and historical accountability.

---

### 8.1 Agile Structure (Scrum-like)

Each project is divided into:

* Backlog (approved scope)
* Iterations / Sprints
* Deliverables per iteration
* Continuous metric reporting

Key rules:

* No hidden scope changes
* All backlog changes are ledger events
* Progress is measured by completed deliverables, not promises

---

### 8.2 PERT / CPM Planning

For each project:

* Tasks are modeled as a dependency graph

* Critical paths are calculated

* Estimated vs actual durations are recorded
  n
  This allows:

* Historical performance analysis

* Detection of artificial delays

* Comparison between planned and real execution

---

### 8.3 Historical Control

The system preserves:

* Task timelines
* Sprint results
* Delays and causes
* Budget deviations

This history feeds back into reputation scoring for future eligibility.

---

### 8.4 Budget and Expense Ledger

All projects must maintain:

* Real-time expense tracking
* Immutable expense records
* Categorized spending (labor, materials, logistics)

Every expense:

* Is linked to a task
* Is signed by responsible actor
* Is auditable at any time

---

### 8.5 Competitive Procurement (Anti-Fraud)

When materials or services are required:

* Open offers are published
* Actors (individuals or companies) submit bids
* Selection is based on:

  * Price
  * Reputation
  * Delivery history

No direct assignment is allowed.

This:

* Prevents shell companies
* Discourages price inflation
* Encourages fair market pricing

---

### 8.6 Transparency for Observers

Any person may:

* View project progress
* Inspect expenses
* Track milestones
* See delays and justifications

This ensures public visibility without interfering in execution.

---

### 8.7 Outcome

Projects become:

* Predictable
* Verifiable
* Economically fair
* Resistant to corruption

Execution quality directly impacts future eligibility and reputation.
